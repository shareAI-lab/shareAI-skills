# LinkedIn

## The Culture

LinkedIn is a professional performance space. Everyone is simultaneously networking, job hunting, recruiting, and building personal brands. The subtext of every post: "I am good at my job and worth knowing."

**The game**: Establish expertise. Build professional credibility. Stay top-of-mind for opportunities.

**What LinkedIn rewards**:
- Insights that make people look smart for sharing
- Career stories with universal lessons
- Contrarian professional takes (within reason)
- Vulnerability that's still professional

**What LinkedIn punishes**:
- Corporate PR disguised as personal posts
- Humble brags that aren't humble enough
- Posting without engaging
- Being too casual OR too formal

## The Mindset

You're speaking at a professional conference, but the hallway conversation version - not the keynote.

**Think like**:
- A respected industry peer sharing lessons
- A mentor giving advice to your past self
- A conference speaker in the Q&A (personal, direct)

**Not like**:
- A company PR department
- A recruiter selling a job
- A motivational poster

## The Anti-Patterns

**Instant scroll-past**:
- "Excited to announce..." (corporate speak)
- "I'm humbled to share..." (false humility)
- Obvious engagement bait ("Comment YES if you agree!")
- Wall of text without line breaks
- Links in the post body (kills reach)

**Cringe patterns**:
- "I was crying in the parking lot, and then..." (trauma porn)
- Fake humility about achievements
- "Agree?" at the end of every post
- Posting about "hustle" and "grind"
- Screenshots of your own notifications

**Career suicide**:
- Complaining about employers (even past ones)
- Controversial politics
- Punching down
- Obvious lies or exaggeration

## The Format

**The LinkedIn-native structure**:
```
[Hook line that stops the scroll - must be < 210 chars]

[Line break]

[Short context or story]

[Line break]

[The insight - 2-3 sentences]

[Line break]

[Supporting points]
• Point one
• Point two
• Point three

[Line break]

[Takeaway or question to drive engagement]

[Line break]

#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3 (3-5 max)

---
Link in comments 👇 (NEVER in post body)
```

**Character limits**:
- First ~210 chars show before "see more" - this IS your headline
- Total limit ~3,000 chars but shorter usually performs better
- Aim for 150-250 words

## The Hook

LinkedIn hooks must work in ~210 characters AND stop professional scrollers.

**High-performing hooks**:
```
"I rejected a $200K offer last week. Here's why:"

"The best career advice I ignored for 10 years:"

"Unpopular opinion: [contrarian professional take]"

"3 things I wish I knew before becoming a [role]:"

"I got fired. It was the best thing that happened to me."
```

**Low-performing hooks**:
```
"I'm excited to share..." (boring, corporate)
"Today I want to talk about..." (slow start)
"Happy to announce..." (PR speak)
"Thoughts on [topic]..." (vague, no promise)
```

## The Quality Bar

Expert LinkedIn posts:
- Feel like genuine professional insight
- Have a clear, memorable takeaway
- Balance vulnerability and professionalism
- Generate comments that become conversations
- Make people want to connect with you

**The test**: Would a CEO read this and think "I should know this person"? Would a junior professional read this and learn something real?

## The Status Game

LinkedIn has unspoken status dynamics:

**What builds status**:
- Sharing genuine learnings from real experience
- Celebrating others (team wins, mentee achievements)
- Offering specific, actionable advice
- Being consistent (2-3 posts/week)

**What destroys status**:
- Humble bragging
- Only posting about yourself
- Never engaging with others' content
- Obvious engagement farming

## Engagement Strategy

**Critical**: LinkedIn algorithm heavily weights early engagement.

- Post at high-activity times (Tue-Thu, 7-9 AM or 12 PM)
- Respond to every comment within first hour
- Ask questions that are easy to answer
- Engage with others' posts daily (not just your own)
- Never use "Link in comments" and then not put the link

**The comment game**:
- Your comments on others' posts build your brand
- Thoughtful comments > many likes
- Add value, don't just agree
- Be seen engaging with industry leaders

## The Voice

Your LinkedIn voice should be:
- Professional but human
- Confident but not arrogant
- Specific about your domain
- Consistent across posts

Think: "Respected industry expert who happens to be approachable." Not: "Corporate account" or "Life coach energy."

## The Unwritten Rules

1. **Never put links in post body** - LinkedIn suppresses reach
2. **Line breaks are essential** - Mobile readers need visual breathing room
3. **Emoji sparingly** - 1-2 okay, more looks unprofessional
4. **Hashtags at end** - 3-5 relevant ones
5. **Engage before posting** - Spend 10 min commenting on others first
6. **Video and carousels** - Higher reach than text-only (if quality is high)
