# Dev.to

## The Culture

Dev.to is the friendly neighborhood of tech writing. It's where developers go to learn, share, and support each other. The vibe is welcoming, practical, and anti-gatekeeping.

**The community ethos**: "We're all learning. Share what you know. Help others level up."

**What Dev.to rewards**:
- Genuine helpfulness
- Beginner-friendly explanations
- "I struggled with X, here's how I figured it out"
- Practical tutorials that actually work
- Honest learning journeys

**What Dev.to punishes**:
- Gatekeeping ("real developers use X")
- Condescension
- Content that assumes too much
- Pure promotion without teaching
- Clickbait that wastes people's time

## The Mindset

You're the senior dev helping a junior teammate - patient, specific, remembering what it was like not to know this.

**Think like**:
- A helpful coworker explaining over someone's shoulder
- A mentor sharing what you wish someone had told you
- A conference speaker who actually answers questions

**Not like**:
- A professor lecturing
- A blogger chasing SEO
- An expert proving how smart you are

## The Anti-Patterns

**Reader abandonment**:
- Missing prerequisites ("You should already know X...")
- Skipping steps in tutorials
- Code that doesn't actually run
- Unexplained jargon
- Assuming context readers don't have

**Trust destruction**:
- Copy-pasted content from elsewhere
- Tutorials that are secretly product promotions
- "10 best X" lists that are actually affiliate links
- Outdated information presented as current

**Community rejection**:
- Gatekeeping language
- Condescending tone
- Not responding to questions
- "RTFM" energy

## The Format

**Frontmatter matters**:
```yaml
---
title: Clear, Searchable, Helpful Title
published: true
description: What readers will learn (shows in previews)
tags: javascript, tutorial, beginners, webdev
cover_image: https://... (optional but helps)
---
```

**The tutorial structure**:
```markdown
## What We're Building

[Screenshot or demo of final result]
[One paragraph: what this is and why it's useful]

## Prerequisites

What you need:
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Basic JavaScript knowledge
- 15 minutes

## Step 1: Setup

[Exact commands to run]
[Explain what each command does]
[Show expected output]

## Step 2: The Core Implementation

[Code with extensive comments]
[Break complex code into chunks]
[Explain the WHY, not just the WHAT]

## Step 3: [Next logical step]

[Continue pattern]

## Common Issues

**Problem**: Error message X
**Solution**: Do Y because Z

**Problem**: It works locally but not in production
**Solution**: Check A, B, C

## What We Learned

- Key takeaway 1
- Key takeaway 2
- Key takeaway 3

## Next Steps

- How to extend this
- Related topics to explore
- Link to repo if applicable

## The Quality Bar

Expert Dev.to posts:
- Could be followed by someone at the stated skill level
- Code actually runs (you tested it)
- Explains decisions, not just steps
- Anticipates common mistakes
- Feels like it was written by someone who cares

**The test**: Send your tutorial to someone at the target skill level. Can they complete it without asking you questions?

## Title Strategy

Dev.to titles should be clear and searchable:

**High-performing patterns**:
```
"How to [Accomplish X] with [Technology Y]"
"[X] for Beginners: A Practical Guide"
"Understanding [Concept]: A Visual Explanation"
"5 [Things] That Improved My [Skill]"
"From [State A] to [State B]: My Learning Journey"
```

**Avoid**:
```
"My Thoughts on X" (vague, no value promise)
"X is Amazing!" (opinion, not useful)
"Advanced X Techniques" (unless truly advanced)
```

## Tag Strategy

Tags are discovery. Use them well.

**Always relevant**:
- `beginners` - huge audience, use if appropriate
- `tutorial` - signals practical content
- Language/framework tags - `javascript`, `python`, `react`
- `webdev` - broad reach

**Tag tips**:
- 4 tags maximum
- Mix broad and specific
- Check tag follower counts
- Don't tag things you barely mention

## The Voice

Your Dev.to voice should be:
- Friendly and encouraging
- Patient with complexity
- Specific and practical
- Humble about your own journey

The best Dev.to writers sound like the colleague everyone loves - knowledgeable, helpful, never makes you feel dumb for asking.

## Engagement

Dev.to is community-driven. Engagement matters.

**Build credibility**:
- Reply to every comment
- Thank people for feedback
- Update posts when errors are found
- Comment helpfully on others' posts
- Follow people in your niche

**Avoid**:
- Posting and disappearing
- Only promoting your own content
- Ignoring questions in comments
- Being defensive about criticism

## The DEV Difference

Unlike other platforms, Dev.to readers:
- Actually want to learn (not just scroll)
- Will try your code (so it better work)
- Appreciate honesty about skill level
- Value practical over theoretical
- Support each other

Write for this audience. They're rooting for you to help them succeed.
