# Twitter/X

## The Culture

Twitter is a performance space where ideas compete for attention in real-time. It rewards speed, personality, and the ability to compress complex ideas into memorable fragments.

**The game**: Earn attention through insight, wit, or controversy. Build an audience that trusts your judgment. Convert that trust into influence.

**Who wins**: People who can make complicated things simple. People who say what others are thinking. People who pick fights with the right enemies. People who share generously and consistently.

**Who loses**: People who sound like press releases. People who only self-promote. People who can't read the room. People who are boring.

## The Mindset

You're not writing content. You're performing on a stage where the audience can leave instantly and heckle publicly.

**Think like**:
- A late-night talk show host (entertaining + informative)
- A graffiti artist (bold, memorable, quick)
- A DJ (reading the room, knowing when to drop the beat)

**Not like**:
- A professor lecturing
- A marketer selling
- A journalist reporting

## The Anti-Patterns

**Instant scroll-past**:
- Starting with "Thread:" or "1/" (weak opener)
- Corporate voice ("We're excited to announce...")
- Too many hashtags (more than 2 = spam)
- Generic motivation ("Work hard, dream big!")
- Asking for engagement ("Please RT!")

**Thread killers**:
- Hook that doesn't deliver
- Padding (could have been 3 tweets, you made it 15)
- No payoff at the end
- Same point repeated with different words

**Character assassination**:
- Deleting tweets when criticized
- Getting into petty arguments
- Punching down
- Being mean without being funny

## The Hook

Your first tweet decides everything. It must work as a standalone - most people won't click to expand.

**High-performing hooks**:
```
"Unpopular opinion: [contrarian take on something everyone assumes]"

"I've mass-migrated 1,000 production databases. Here's what breaks:"

"The best advice I ever ignored (and why I was wrong):"

"[Famous thing] is a lie. Here's what actually works:"

"I spent 6 months doing [thing]. 3 lessons I can't unlearn:"
```

**Dead-on-arrival hooks**:
```
"Thread on X" (boring, no promise)
"Let me tell you about..." (slow, self-focused)
"I've been thinking about..." (who cares?)
"Some thoughts on..." (vague, low-value promise)
"1/ Here's how to..." (never start with "1/")
```

## Thread Architecture

**The shape of a great thread**:
```
Tweet 1: HOOK - Promise something specific and intriguing
         Must stand alone, must stop the scroll

Tweet 2: Context or credibility (brief)
         Why should I listen to you?

Tweet 3-N: Deliver the value
           One idea per tweet
           Each tweet should be retweetable alone

Tweet N+1: Callback to hook + clear ending
           Don't just stop - conclude

Tweet N+2: CTA (if any) - follow, link, etc.
           Separated from the content
```

**Formatting for mobile**:
```
This is how to
break lines
for readability

Short sentences.
Punchy.
Clear.

→ Arrows for lists
→ Or bullets
→ Not more than 4

"Quotes stand out"

ALL CAPS sparingly for EMPHASIS

Numbers work: 3 reasons, 5 steps, 1 truth
```

## Visual Strategy

Text-only threads compete on pure writing. Add visuals to multiply reach.

**What works**:
- Screenshots of code (Carbon.now.sh)
- Before/after comparisons
- Simple diagrams (Excalidraw)
- Terminal output
- Charts with one clear insight
- Short video demos (< 30 sec)

**What doesn't**:
- Stock photos
- Complex diagrams
- Walls of text as images
- Low-quality screenshots

## The Quality Bar

Expert Twitter content:
- Could go viral with the right timing
- Gets quoted by others
- Generates replies that become conversations
- Works as standalone wisdom
- Reflects a consistent, recognizable voice

**The test**: Would someone screenshot this tweet to share elsewhere? If not, it's not sharp enough.

## Engagement Rules

Twitter rewards conversation, not broadcasting.

- Reply to good comments (especially early)
- Quote-tweet your thread to bump it
- Engage with others in your niche daily
- Don't just like - reply with substance
- Credit sources, tag relevant people (sparingly)

**Timing**: First 30 minutes determine a tweet's fate. Be available to engage.

## The Voice

Your Twitter voice should be:
- Distinctly you (not generic)
- Consistent across tweets
- Slightly more bold than real life
- Memorable enough to be imitated

The best Twitter accounts feel like a friend who happens to be an expert. Not a brand. Not a professor. A person with opinions and personality.
