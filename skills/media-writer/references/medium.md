# Medium

## The Culture

Medium is where people go to read, not scroll. It's the platform for those who still believe in long-form writing - readers who want depth, narrative, and ideas that take time to unfold.

**The implicit promise**: "I will spend 8 minutes reading this, and you will make it worth my time."

**What Medium rewards**:
- Stories, not just information
- Personal journey wrapped around insight
- Writing that sounds like a human, not a textbook
- Ideas that change how readers think

**What Medium punishes**:
- Clickbait that doesn't deliver
- Shallow listicles
- Corporate content disguised as articles
- Writing without a voice

## The Mindset

You're not writing a blog post. You're crafting an experience.

**Think like**:
- A magazine feature writer (narrative structure, pacing)
- A documentary filmmaker (show, don't tell)
- A TED speaker (one big idea, well-supported)

**Not like**:
- A blogger filling content calendars
- A journalist reporting facts
- A marketer educating prospects

## The Anti-Patterns

**Instant abandon**:
- Title that overpromises ("The ULTIMATE guide", "Everything you need to know")
- Opening paragraph that's pure setup ("In today's fast-paced world...")
- No hook in first 30 seconds
- Generic stock photo that says nothing

**Mid-article drop**:
- Walls of text without visual breaks
- Sections that don't build on each other
- No story arc - just information dumping
- Losing the thread of the main argument

**Finish-but-won't-share**:
- Weak conclusion that just summarizes
- No memorable takeaway
- Missing the "so what"
- Ending without landing

## The Structure

**Title**: Promise + Intrigue
```
GOOD:
"What I Learned Mass-Migrating 1,000 Databases (And What I'd Do Differently)"
"The Hidden Cost of Free Software"
"Why I Stopped Calling Myself a Senior Engineer"

BAD:
"Database Migration Guide"
"Thoughts on Open Source"
"My Career Journey"
```

**Subtitle**: Expand the promise, add context
```
GOOD: "After 3 years of microservices, here's why we're going back to the monolith"
BAD: "Some lessons learned from my experience"
```

**Opening**: Hook within 2 sentences
```
GOOD:
"The email came at 3 AM: 'Production is down. Again.'"
"I've mass-migrated 1,000 databases. I also have nightmares."
"Everyone told me microservices were the answer. They were wrong."

BAD:
"In this article, I will discuss..."
"Database migrations are an important topic..."
"As a software engineer with 10 years of experience..."
```

**Body**: The journey structure
```
1. HOOK - The moment that changes everything
2. CONTEXT - Quick background (minimal)
3. CHALLENGE - What you faced
4. JOURNEY - What you tried, what failed, what worked
5. INSIGHT - The lesson that emerged
6. APPLICATION - How readers can use this
7. LANDING - Circle back, elevate, conclude
```

## The Quality Bar

Expert Medium articles:
- Read like they took weeks to write (even if they didn't)
- Have a clear through-line from start to finish
- Balance story and substance
- Include specific details that prove you lived this
- End with something quotable

**The test**: Read your article out loud. Does it sound like something you'd want to listen to? Or does it sound like homework?

## The Craft Details

**Paragraph rhythm**:
- Mix short and long
- Never more than 4-5 lines in a paragraph
- Single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis
- White space is your friend

**Visual breaks**:
- Headers every 300-400 words
- Pull quotes for key insights
- Code blocks for technical content
- Images that add meaning (not decoration)

**Voice markers**:
- "I" is encouraged - this is personal
- Asides and parentheticals (like this) add personality
- Rhetorical questions engage readers
- Humor works when authentic

## Publication Strategy

Medium's algorithm favors publication distribution.

**Top tech publications**:
- Towards Data Science (ML/AI/Data)
- Better Programming (Software engineering)
- The Startup (General tech)
- UX Collective (Design)

**Why publications matter**:
- Built-in audience
- Editorial review signals quality
- Better distribution
- Credibility by association

**Submission tips**:
- Read 5-10 articles from the publication first
- Match their style and depth
- Follow submission guidelines exactly
- Be patient - good publications are selective

## The Voice

Your Medium voice should be:
- Personal but professional
- Confident but not arrogant
- Specific but accessible
- Thoughtful and deliberate

The best Medium writers sound like the smartest person you know explaining something they care deeply about - informed, passionate, but never talking down to you.

## The Hook Density

Unlike Twitter (one hook) or WeChat (hooks every 3 sentences), Medium needs strategic hooks:

- **Opening**: Must hook within 50 words
- **Section starts**: Each new section re-earns attention
- **Before key insights**: Build anticipation
- **Conclusion**: Hook for the share

Everything in between can breathe. Readers chose to be here. Respect that by providing depth between hooks.
