# Reddit

## The Culture

Reddit is not one community - it's thousands of villages, each with its own customs, inside jokes, and ways of establishing status. What works in r/programming will get you banned in r/MachineLearning.

**The fundamental rule**: Reddit hates being marketed to. The community can smell self-promotion from miles away. But they'll celebrate genuine sharing.

**What Reddit rewards**:
- Authenticity over polish
- "I made this / I learned this / I failed at this"
- Helping others without expecting anything
- Being part of the community, not above it

**What Reddit punishes**:
- Corporate voice
- Cross-posting spam
- "Experts" who don't engage
- Any hint of manipulation

## The Mindset

You're not posting content. You're joining a conversation that's been going on for years.

**Imagine**: You walk into a bar where everyone knows each other. You don't announce yourself. You don't hand out business cards. You buy a round, tell a good story, and maybe mention what you're working on if it's relevant.

**The status game on Reddit**:
- Karma is reputation, earned through contribution
- Awards signal community approval
- Being featured on "top" means you added value
- Being downvoted to oblivion means you broke a rule (written or unwritten)

## The Anti-Patterns

**Instant downvote**:
- Title that sounds like an ad
- Posting without reading subreddit rules
- "Check out my project!" without context
- Not including TL;DR for long posts
- Posting and disappearing

**Slow death**:
- Defending your work instead of learning from criticism
- Posting the same thing to multiple subreddits simultaneously
- Never commenting on other people's posts
- Being offended by harsh feedback

**Permanent ban risk**:
- Astroturfing (fake accounts supporting you)
- Vote manipulation
- Affiliate links without disclosure
- Repeatedly breaking subreddit rules

## Subreddit Fluency

Each subreddit is a different game. Study before posting.

**r/programming**
- Culture: News-focused, skeptical, experienced devs
- What wins: Technical depth, contrarian takes, real war stories
- What fails: Beginner content, "I made my first app" posts

**r/MachineLearning**
- Culture: Academic, research-focused, high bar
- What wins: Papers, benchmarks, novel approaches
- What fails: Hype, "AI will replace X" takes

**r/LocalLLaMA**
- Culture: Tinkerers, open-source advocates, hands-on
- What wins: Actual results, quantization tips, model comparisons
- What fails: Hype without benchmarks, closed-source promotion

**r/SideProject / r/indiehackers**
- Culture: Supportive builders, feedback-oriented
- What wins: Honest journey posts, "roast my project" requests
- What fails: Pure promotion, no vulnerability

## The Post Structure

**Title**: Factual, intriguing, community-appropriate
```
GOOD:
"After 2 years of side projects failing, this one finally got 1k users. Here's what changed."
"I reverse-engineered X's algorithm. Here's how it works."
"Honest review after 6 months using X for production"

BAD:
"Check out my AMAZING new tool!!"
"The BEST way to do X"
"I built something cool"
```

**Body**:
```markdown
**TL;DR**: [One sentence summary - Reddit culture demands this]

---

[Hook - why should anyone care?]

[Context - brief background, establish credibility]

[The meat - what you learned/built/discovered]

[Specifics - technical details, numbers, evidence]

[What you're looking for - feedback? discussion? just sharing?]

---

**Links:**
- [GitHub/Demo/etc.]

Happy to answer questions!
```

## The Quality Bar

Expert Reddit posts:
- Feel like a community member sharing, not a marketer posting
- Invite discussion, not just consumption
- Show vulnerability (what you don't know, where you failed)
- Are generous with knowledge
- Engage deeply in comments

**The test**: Read your post pretending you're a skeptical community member who's seen a thousand "check out my project" posts. Does yours feel different?

## Engagement is Everything

On Reddit, the comments ARE the content.

- Reply to every thoughtful comment
- Thank people for criticism (especially harsh criticism)
- Admit when you're wrong
- Share additional details in comments
- Stay in the thread for at least 2-3 hours after posting

**The upvote spiral**: Early engagement signals quality to the algorithm. Good comments attract more viewers, which attracts more comments. Be present at launch.

## The Voice

Your Reddit voice should be:
- Humble but not self-deprecating
- Technical but accessible
- Personal but not oversharing
- Helpful without being preachy

The best Reddit posts read like a message from a thoughtful friend who happens to have experience with exactly what you're struggling with.
