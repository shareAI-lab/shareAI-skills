# Hacker News

## The Culture

HN is a community of builders who've seen everything. They were excited about AI in 2015, tired of blockchain by 2018, and skeptical of whatever you're selling today. They've built startups, watched them fail, and built again. They value substance over everything.

**The unspoken hierarchy**:
- Top: People who've built things and share genuine learnings
- Middle: People who ask thoughtful questions
- Bottom: People who promote without contributing

**What earns respect**: Technical depth. Intellectual honesty. Admitting what you don't know. Showing your work. Being useful to the community.

**What earns contempt**: Marketing speak. Hype. Claiming to have "revolutionized" anything. Ignoring valid criticism. Not engaging with comments.

## The Mindset

Write like you're explaining something to a smart colleague over coffee, not like you're pitching to investors.

**Think**:
- "Here's what I built and what I learned"
- "I found this interesting, thought you might too"
- "This is how we solved X, curious if others have different approaches"

**Not**:
- "Introducing the future of X!"
- "10 ways to Y that will change your life"
- "We're disrupting Z"

## The Anti-Patterns

**Instant death**:
- Superlatives: "best", "ultimate", "revolutionary", "game-changing"
- Marketing buzzwords: "leverage", "synergy", "unlock", "empower"
- Startup-speak: "we're democratizing X", "10x improvement"
- Clickbait patterns: "You won't believe...", "What happened next..."
- Self-congratulation: "Excited to announce...", "Proud to share..."

**Slow death**:
- Not responding to comments (you MUST engage)
- Getting defensive when criticized
- Repeating the same content across multiple posts
- Astroturfing (fake grassroots support)

## The Craft

**Title engineering**:
```
GOOD:
"Show HN: I built X to solve Y"
"We reduced latency from 200ms to 5ms. Here's how"
"A deep dive into SQLite's query planner"
"Why we switched from Kubernetes back to VMs"

BAD:
"The ULTIMATE guide to X"
"This will CHANGE how you think about Y"
"Why everyone is wrong about Z"
"Introducing X: The future of Y"
```

**First comment strategy** (for Show HN):
Your first comment is crucial. It should:
- Explain what it is in plain language
- Why you built it (the real reason, not marketing)
- What you're hoping to learn from the community
- Known limitations or areas you're uncertain about

**Engagement rules**:
- Reply to every substantive comment
- Thank people for good feedback, even criticism
- Say "good point, I hadn't considered that" when appropriate
- Never argue with trolls - ignore them
- Update your post if someone points out errors

## The Quality Bar

A great HN post feels like:
- An experienced engineer sharing hard-won knowledge
- Someone genuinely curious, not trying to sell
- A peer who respects the audience's intelligence
- Content that took time and thought to create

**Ask yourself**: Would a senior engineer at a top company find this valuable? If not, it's not ready.

## The Hook

HN readers scan titles at high speed. Your title must:
1. Be factual (not hyperbolic)
2. Promise something specific
3. Feel authentic
4. Intrigue without misleading

The best HN posts often have almost boring titles - the substance speaks for itself.

## Cultural Signals

**Positive signals**:
- Linking to source code
- Showing benchmarks with methodology
- Acknowledging prior art
- Mentioning tradeoffs and limitations

**Negative signals**:
- Linking only to a landing page
- No technical details
- Ignoring competitors/alternatives
- "We're hiring!" in the post
